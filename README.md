-   User story: On mobile, when I select the hamburger menu, I can see a navigation
-   Technical requirement : use **BEM** notation with **SASS** to practice your skills

As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

Good luck everybody!
